# Components -> Email

A proof of concept for converting JS components to as widely compatible HTML email files.

**Goals**

-   [ ] Make a group of standard components that work in all clients (most clients)
-   [ ] Create a basic wrapper (consumer?) that can be simply fed content or column components
-   [ ] CSS Inlining
-   [ ] ???
-   [ ] PROFIT

## Status

**NOT WORKING**

This is an evolving proof of concept. If this is something that sounds relevant to your needs, checkout either [emailframe.work](https://emailframe.work/) or [MJML](https://mjml.io)

## Road blocks

-   Not sure how to generate html file from preact-render-to-string
-   Is it possible to move away from preact without delving too deep into Node or other ~~boring~~ server-like api's
-   other stuff???
